# Exercise 9 - Viewing history

1. Make a commit with a multi line commit message
   (leaving an empty line after the first line)

2. View that commit in the log

        git log -1

3. View the full commit log

        git log

*If the log fills your whole terminal, press `q` to exit*

4. View a shortened version of the commit log

        git log --oneline

        c62aa89 (HEAD -> main) added new item
        aec47f9 New file "clothing.txt"
        2982b7a deleted onions, second commit
        f08659b added and deleted to the files, second commit
        6983188 Added items to files
        a8eaed1 Added items to files
        b49815e First commit
        d76b13e Added more fruit to the list
        b181a38 First commit :w

5. Pick a commit hash from the log

6. View the commit log from the chosen commit backward

        git log --oneline <commit_hash>

7. How much of the commit hash do you need to specify? Hint, run `git help log`
 
        eight to ten characters are enough

8. How can you show just the last three commit messages?
        git log -3 to show the last three commit messages.
